# Flower-Bouquet
Bloom &amp; Bliss is a simple flower bouquet website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a login system, bouquet selection, and a homepage showcasing popular bouquets and services. This project helps beginners learn frontend design, form handling, and page navigation.  If you want, I can make it exactly 300 characters or shorter 👍
